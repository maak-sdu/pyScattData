# iq_sq_fq_gr_plotter
This code will plot .iq, .sq, .fq, and .gr files together.
The plot will show the gradually transformation from the background-subtracted
intensity, I(Q), to the total scattering structure function, S(Q), through the
reduced total scattering structure function, F(Q), and finally arriving at the
reduced atomic pair distribution function, G(r).
