# iq_sq_fq_gr_plot
This code will plot .iq, .sq, .fq, and .gr files together in a figure with four
subplots.

The figure will illustrate the gradually transformation from the
background-subtracted intensity, I(Q), to the total scattering structure
function, S(Q), through the reduced total scattering structure function, F(Q),
and finally arriving at the reduced atomic pair distribution function, G(r).
