# h5_extract_write_plot
This code is made for extracting x-ray scattering data from .h5 files.

The files in the example folder stem from a beamtime at the DanMAX beamline
at the MAXIV synchrotron, Lund, Sweden.
X-ray scattering data is extracted from the .h5 files and written to a
two-column text file (e.g. .xy), where the file format is provided by the user.
If wished for, plots of each .h5 file are made as .pdf and .png files.
