# ras_to_csv_convert_plot
This code converts .ras to .csv files and plots the intensity vs. 2theta. .ras
files are the output files from the Rigaku Miniflex 600 tabletop powder x-ray
diffractometer at the Department of Physics, Chemistry, and Pharmacy, University
of Southern Denmark. .csv files contain comma-separated values. The .csv files
in question contain the Bragg angle in degrees in the first column and the
intensities in the second column, separated by a comma. The plots show the
powder x-ray diffractograms with the intensity as a function of the Bragg angle
in degrees.
