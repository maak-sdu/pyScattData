# ras_to_csv_convert_plot
This code converts .ras to .csv files and plots the intensity vs. 2theta. .ras
files are the output files from the Rigaku Miniflex 600 table top powder x-ray
diffractometer at the Department of Physics, Chemistry, and Pharmacy, University
of Southern Denmark. .csv files are comma-separated values.
Hence, the .csv files are two-column files containing the 2theta values in
degrees in the first column and the intensities in the second column, separated
by a comma. The plots shows the powder x-ray diffractograms with the intensity
as a function of the Bragg angle, 2theta, in degrees.
