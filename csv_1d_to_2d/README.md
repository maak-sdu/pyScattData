This code is made for Postdoc Christian Kolle Christensen of the Ravnsb√¶k Group
in the Autumn of 2021 and Spring of 2022.

From a powder x-ray diffraction mapping experiment, the results of the
corresponding Rietveld refinements have been exported as 1D columns.
The code in this repository allows you to convert each 1D column into 2D
matrices when the number of rows is provided by the user. The resulting matrices
are exported as .txt files and plotted as .pdf and .png files.
