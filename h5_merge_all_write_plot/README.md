# h5_merge_all_write_plot

This code is made for merging all subframes of a .h5 file and writing the merged
scattering data to an .xy file. This is done for all .h5 in a directory called
'h5'.

Upon request from the user, all merged individual scans will be plotted and
saved to .pdf and .png files in the 'pdf' and 'png' folders.

All merged scans will be plotted in an overview plot and saved to .pdf and .png
files in the 'pdf' and 'png' folders.

The data in the 'example' folder stems from a commissioning beamtime of Ravnsb√¶k
Group at the DanMAX beamline at MAXIV.
