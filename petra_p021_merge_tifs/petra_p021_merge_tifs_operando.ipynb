    "# Merging .tif files from *operando* total scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is written for merging subframes from *operando* total scattering \n",
    "experiments conducted on beamline P02.1, PETRA III, DESY, using the \n",
    "`ravnsbaek.py` macro.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the total scattering experiment, a single exposure exposure is split into \n",
    "multiple subframes, which are to be merged by this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "At earlier beamtimes, an exposure time of four minutes per cycle was used, \n",
    "meaning that four subframes were to be merged. However, as long as the naming \n",
    "scheme below is followed, the code should work for other exposure times, number \n",
    "of frames to merge, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming scheme\n",
    "For the code to be able to sort the files properly, the following name scheme is\n",
    "expected:\n",
    "```\n",
    "POSITION_NAME_CYCLENUMBER-RUNNINGNUMBER.tif\n",
    "```\n",
    "e.g.:\n",

    "## Running the code\n",
    "The code should be run from a directory containing the `.tif` files that are to\n",
    "be merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only three modules are used in the code. The ``pathlib`` module is a part of the\n",
    "standard library and comes with your Python installation. In addition, the \n",
    "``numpy`` and ``scikit-image`` modules are used. For the code to function, these \n",
    "modules need to be installed if not already.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a conda distribution and you need a new environment using e.g.\n",

    "conda create -n py311 -c conda-forge python=3.11 numpy scikit-image jupyterlab\n",
    "```\n",
    "The newly created conda environment can then be activated:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate py311\n",
